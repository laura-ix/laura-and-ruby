# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print â€œFizzBuzz"

(1..100).each do |x|

  if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0
    puts "FizzBuzz"
  elsif x % 3 == 0
    puts "Fizz"
  elsif x % 5 == 0
    puts "Buzz"
  else puts x
  end
